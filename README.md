# Features
## Not a pretty GUI, but functional!
The gui will probably not take up your entire screen, this is to ensure it will fit on all screens

## Saving and selecting urls
![idk](https://github.com/LittleBigPatcherTeam/LittleBigPatcher-for-Custom-Servers-PS3-Homebrew/blob/main/screenshots_for_readme/menu_select_urls.png?raw=true)<br/>
You can save up to 9 urls for easy switching between servers, and with 98 possible differnt pages of urls, that adds up to 882 differnt urls to be saved! (use D-Pad left and right to change pages)

## Why are there 2 parts to a url?
![idk](https://github.com/LittleBigPatcherTeam/LittleBigPatcher-for-Custom-Servers-PS3-Homebrew/blob/main/screenshots_for_readme/menu_edit_urls_on_custom_digest.png?raw=true)<br/>
You'll notice when going to the Edit urls menu, when you go down, it selects a space after the actual url, or text after the space. This is the digest, now you do not need to know what a digest is, all you need to know is that if you are adding a Refresh based custom server, for the digest enter in `CustomServerDigest` otherwise leave it empty

## What is a Title id?
First of all, you want to get the title id of your game, and make sure that the game is updated, for discs, you can just look at the bottom spin of the case, or at the bottom of the disc (do not include the `-`), 

# Building
Youd want to use linux, or wsl on windows in order to build this, basically you need to be able to build the [Tiny3D samples](https://github.com/wargio/tiny3D/tree/master/samples/sprites2D) in order to build this.<br/>
also you'll need to install [dbglogger](https://github.com/bucanero/dbglogger)<br/>
then you can run the python script in python3 `python3 build.py` in order to build!
